# Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Problem
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

    f= [1, 2]

    next = 0
    sum = 0

    while next < 4000000:
      next = f[-1] + f[-2] # Sum of last two numbers in series
      f.append(next)

    for i in f:
      if (i % 2 == 0):
        sum += i

    print(sum)

I used a list to store the values of the fibonacci sequence. In order to calculate the terms, I used a loop which repeats itself until the final value is greater than 4 million, it takes the last two terms of the list and adds them together to make the next term.

I then iterated over my list of terms, adding up numbers that were even.
